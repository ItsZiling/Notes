title: Discrete Structure
---


This is introductory course that talks about the basics of discrete math.
It is similar to an introductory math proof course but is specifically tailored towards Computer Science students.

### Discrete Structure

- By definition, a discrete structure is used to describe a set of elements with gaps in between each elements, it is the opposite to a continuous structure.
  - This is a particularly an important concept when it comes data structure in Computer Science since all data structure are discrete.
